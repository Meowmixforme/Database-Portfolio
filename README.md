## SQL (Sections 1–8: PostgreSQL)

Below you will find a description of the contents and purpose of each of the eight main directories in this portfolio. All SQL code and exercises within sections 1–8 are written for PostgreSQL.

1. **1 Fundamentals**  
   This folder contains introductory SQL queries covering the foundational elements of the language. Scripts in this section demonstrate basic `SELECT` statements, filtering data with `WHERE`, sorting results with `ORDER BY`, using pattern matching with `LIKE` and `ILIKE`, and employing simple aggregate functions such as `COUNT`. These examples are ideal for beginners to gain an understanding of fundamental SQL operations in PostgreSQL.

2. **2 GROUP BY**  
   This directory explores the use of the `GROUP BY` clause in SQL. The scripts focus on grouping data by one or more columns and applying aggregate functions like `SUM`, `AVG`, `MAX`, `MIN`, and `COUNT` to grouped results. It presents practical scenarios for summarising data and extracting insights from grouped datasets, which are essential skills for data analysis.

3. **3 JOINS**  
   Here, you will find example queries demonstrating different types of table joins in SQL, including `INNER JOIN`, `LEFT JOIN`, `RIGHT JOIN`, and `FULL OUTER JOIN`. These scripts illustrate how to combine data from multiple tables based on related columns, showcasing both basic and more complex join conditions.

4. **4 Advanced SQL Commands**  
   This section delves into more advanced SQL functionalities available in PostgreSQL. The queries cover topics such as subqueries, window functions, common table expressions (CTEs), set operations (`UNION`, `INTERSECT`, etc.), and advanced filtering techniques. This directory is intended for learners looking to deepen their SQL proficiency beyond the basics.

5. **5 Exercises**  
   This folder contains a series of practical exercises designed to reinforce and test your understanding of SQL. Each script presents a problem or challenge, encouraging hands-on practice with query writing and logical thinking. The problems range from basic to advanced, making this section suitable for revision and self-assessment.

6. **6 Creating Databases and Tables**  
   In this directory, you will find scripts focused on data definition language (DDL) commands in PostgreSQL. The examples demonstrate how to create new databases and tables, define columns and data types, set primary and foreign keys, and implement other structural constraints. This section is essential for learning how to design and implement a relational database schema.

7. **7 Conditional Expressions and Procedures**  
   This section includes examples of using conditional expressions such as `CASE` statements within SQL queries. It may also contain scripts demonstrating the creation and use of stored procedures and functions in PostgreSQL, illustrating how to encapsulate logic and control flow within the database.

8. **8 Python and PostgreSQL**  
   This folder bridges SQL and programming by providing example scripts that integrate Python with PostgreSQL. It features Python code (often using libraries such as `psycopg2` or `SQLAlchemy`) to connect to a PostgreSQL database, execute queries, and process results. This section is valuable for those interested in automating database tasks or developing data-driven applications using Python.
